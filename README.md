### F1 2021 Rich Presence for Discord
Simple Discord RPC client for the game F1 2021.

##### To-do List

- [x] Display the team the player is driving for
- [x] Display how many rounds the player has driven and how many rounds in a race are left [e.g Lap 13/52]
- [x] Display the percentage of completion of a race [Will also be shown in Training and Qualifying, but these numbers will be irrelevant.]
